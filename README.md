## Installation

To install, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danidomi/cdeps/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After the installation process is complete, make sure to add it to your bash, by default it does the following:

```shell
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Commands

After installation, you can use `cdeps` to manage your C project's dependencies. Run `cdeps` with the desired command
and optional arguments:

### usage

The usage command shows what are the possible commands in `cdeps`.

```shell
cdeps
```

### clean

The clean command removes object files and cached files generated by the build process.

```shell
cdeps clean
```

### install

The install command installs C dependencies for your project. You can specify the dependency by providing a package URL
and version, or you can simply run the command to install all dependencies listed in the c.deps file.

#### install a specific package

```shell
cdeps install github.com/danidomi/c-framework@latest
```

To install dependencies for your project using `cdeps` simply run the following command:

```shell
cdeps install
```

`cdeps` will look for a `"c.deps"` file in your project directory, fetch the specified dependencies and install them.

#### install from "c.deps" file

You can create a `"c.deps"` file to define your project's dependencies. The file should contain a list of dependencies
in the following format:

```shell
<repoName> <version>
```

Here's an example `"c.deps"` file:

``` 
github.com/user/libfoo latest
github.com/user/libbar 1.0.0
```

In this example, we specify two dependencies: `"libfoo"` and `"libbar"`.

`"libfoo"` is set to use the latest available version, while `"libbar"` is locked to version `1.0.0`.

`cdeps` will fetch these dependencies and ensure that they are available for your project.

### list

The list command displays a list of installed dependencies.

```shell
cdeps list
```

### version

The version command prints the version of `cdeps` installed.

```shell
cdeps version
```
