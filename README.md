## Usage
After installation, you can use cdeps to manage your C project's dependencies. Run cdeps with the desired command and optional arguments:

```shell
cdeps
```

## Commands

### clean
The clean command removes object files and cached files generated by the build process.

```shell
cdeps clean
```

### install
The install command compiles and installs C dependencies for your project. You can specify the dependency by providing a package URL and version, or you can simply run the command to install all dependencies listed in the c.deps file.

To install a specific package:

```shell
cdeps install github.com/danidomi/c-framework@latest
```
To install all dependencies listed in the c.deps file:

```shell
cdeps install
```

The c.deps file should contain a list of dependencies with package URLs and versions that cdeps will use to compile and install the required dependencies.

### list
The list command displays a list of installed dependencies.

```shell
cdeps list
```

### version
The version command prints the version of cdeps you have installed.

```shell
cdeps version
```
